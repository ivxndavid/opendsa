# Quick Sort (Coming Soon)

Quick Sort is an efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## Complexity

| Type | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Worst)** | $O(n^2)$ |
| **Time (Average)** | $O(n \log n)$ |
| **Time (Best)** | $O(n \log n)$ |
| **Space** | $O(\log n)$ |

## Concepts

- **Pivot Selection**: Choosing the right pivot is crucial for performance.
- **Partitioning**: Reordering the array so that elements < pivot come before elements > pivot.
