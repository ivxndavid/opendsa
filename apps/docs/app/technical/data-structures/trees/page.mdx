Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary tree where the key in each node is greater than all keys in the left subtree and less than all keys in the right subtree.

### Properties
- **Root**: Topmost node.
- **Leaf**: Node with no children.
- **Height**: Number of edges on the longest path from node to leaf.
