# Arrays (Coming Soon)

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. It is one of the simplest and most widely used data structures.

## Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Access** | $O(1)$ |
| **Search** | $O(n)$ |
| **Insertion** | $O(n)$ |
| **Deletion** | $O(n)$ |

## Visualization

In OpenDSA, arrays are visualized as a row of bars or boxes.
- **Highlight**: Change color to indicate comparison or access.
- **Swap**: Animate position exchange.
