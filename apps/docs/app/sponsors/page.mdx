# Support OpenDSA

OpenDSA is 100% free and open source. We believe everyone should have access to quality algorithm visualizations for learning. No paywalls. No premium tiers. Just pure, open education.

## Why Support Us?

We're committed to keeping OpenDSA free forever. Your support helps us:

- **Host reliable infrastructure** - Fast servers, CDN, and uptime
- **Develop new features** - More algorithms, better visualizations
- **Maintain the project** - Bug fixes, security updates, documentation
- **Grow the community** - Events, educational content, outreach

## Current Hosting

OpenDSA is currently hosted on **Vercel's free tier**. As the project grows, we may need to scale to handle more traffic and features.
